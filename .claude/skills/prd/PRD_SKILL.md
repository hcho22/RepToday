# PRD Generator

Create detailed Product Requirements Documents that are clear, actionable, and suitable for implementation.

---

## The Job

1. Receive a feature description from the user
2. Ask 3-5 essential clarifying questions (with lettered options)
3. Generate a structured PRD based on answers
4. Save to `.claude/agent/tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

**Important:** Do NOT start implementing. Just create the PRD.

---

## Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous. Focus on:

- **Problem/Goal:** What problem does this solve?
- **Core Functionality:** What are the key actions?
- **Scope/Boundaries:** What should it NOT do?
- **Success Criteria:** How do we know it's done?

### Format Questions Like This:

```
1. What is the primary goal of this feature?
   A. Improve user onboarding experience
   B. Increase user retention
   C. Reduce support burden
   D. Other: [please specify]

2. Who is the target user?
   A. New users only
   B. Existing users only
   C. All users
   D. Admin users only

3. What is the scope?
   A. Minimal viable version
   B. Full-featured implementation
   C. Just the backend/API
   D. Just the UI
```

This lets users respond with "1A, 2C, 3B" for quick iteration.

## Step 2: PRD Structure

Generate the PRD with these sections:

### 1. Introduction/Overview

Brief description of the feature and the problem it solves.

### 2. Goals

Specific, measurable objectives (bullet list).

### 3. User Stories

Each story needs:

- **Title:** Short descriptive name
- **Description:** "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Verifiable checklist of what "done" means

Each story should be small enough to implement in one focused session.

**Format:**

```markdown
### US-001: [Title]

**Description:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Specific verifiable criterion
- [ ] Another criterion
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
- [ ] **[UI stories only]** Verify in browser using dev-browser skill

**Validation Test:**

- **Setup:** [Preconditions or test data needed]
- **Steps:**
  1. [Concrete action to perform]
  2. [Next action]
- **Expected Result:** [What should happen if the story is implemented correctly]
- **Failure Indicator:** [What would indicate the implementation is broken]
```

**Important:**

- Acceptance criteria must be verifiable, not vague. "Works correctly" is bad. "Button shows confirmation dialog before deleting" is good.
- **For any story with UI changes:** Always include "Verify in browser using dev-browser skill" as acceptance criteria. This ensures visual verification of frontend work.
- **Every user story must include a Validation Test.** This is a short, concrete, manually runnable test that proves the story works end-to-end. It should describe the setup, steps, expected result, and what failure looks like. Think of it as a mini QA script — specific enough that anyone (including an AI agent) can execute it without guessing.

### 4. Functional Requirements

Numbered list of specific functionalities:

- "FR-1: The system must allow users to..."
- "FR-2: When a user clicks X, the system must..."

Be explicit and unambiguous.

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

What this feature will NOT include. Critical for managing scope.

### 6. Design Considerations (Optional)

- UI/UX requirements
- Link to mockups if available
- Relevant existing components to reuse

### 7. Technical Considerations (Optional)

- Known constraints or dependencies
- Integration points with existing systems
- Performance requirements

### 8. Success Metrics

How will success be measured?

- "Reduce time to complete X by 50%"
- "Increase conversion rate by 10%"

### 9. Open Questions

Remaining questions or areas needing clarification.

## Writing for Junior Developers

The PRD reader may be a junior developer or AI agent. Therefore:

- Be explicit and unambiguous
- Avoid jargon or explain it
- Provide enough detail to understand purpose and core logic
- Number requirements for easy reference
- Use concrete examples where helpful

---

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `.claude/agent/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `prd-[feature-name].md` (kebab-case)

# PRD: Task Priority System

## Introduction

Add priority levels to tasks so users can focus on what matters most. Tasks can be marked as high, medium, or low priority, with visual indicators and filtering to help users manage their workload effectively.

## Goals

- Allow assigning priority (high/medium/low) to any task
- Provide clear visual differentiation between priority levels
- Enable filtering and sorting by priority
- Default new tasks to medium priority

## User Stories

### US-001: Add priority field to database

**Description:** As a developer, I need to store task priority so it persists across sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Add priority column to tasks table: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low' (default 'medium')
- [ ] Generate and run migration successfully
- [ ] Typecheck passes

**Validation Test:**

- **Setup:** Clean database with existing tasks table
- **Steps:**
  1. Run the migration
  2. Insert a new task without specifying priority
  3. Insert a task with priority set to 'high'
  4. Query both tasks
- **Expected Result:** First task has priority 'medium' (default). Second task has priority 'high'. No errors.
- **Failure Indicator:** Migration fails, default is missing, or column rejects valid values

### US-002: Display priority indicator on task cards

**Description:** As a user, I want to see task priority at a glance so I know what needs attention first.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Each task card shows colored priority badge (red=high, yellow=medium, gray=low)
- [ ] Priority visible without hovering or clicking
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Verify in browser using dev-browser skill

**Validation Test:**

- **Setup:** Three tasks exist, one at each priority level (high, medium, low)
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the task list page
  2. Inspect each task card visually
- **Expected Result:** High-priority task shows a red badge, medium shows yellow, low shows gray. Badges are visible without interaction.
- **Failure Indicator:** Badges are missing, wrong color, or only appear on hover

### US-003: Add priority selector to task edit

**Description:** As a user, I want to change a task's priority when editing it.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Priority dropdown in task edit modal
- [ ] Shows current priority as selected
- [ ] Saves immediately on selection change
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Verify in browser using dev-browser skill

**Validation Test:**

- **Setup:** A task exists with priority 'low'
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the task edit modal for the task
  2. Confirm the priority dropdown shows 'low' selected
  3. Change priority to 'high'
  4. Close and reopen the modal
- **Expected Result:** Dropdown updates immediately on selection. After reopening, 'high' is the selected value. Database reflects the change.
- **Failure Indicator:** Dropdown doesn't show current value, change doesn't persist, or requires a separate save action

### US-004: Filter tasks by priority

**Description:** As a user, I want to filter the task list to see only high-priority items when I'm focused.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Filter dropdown with options: All | High | Medium | Low
- [ ] Filter persists in URL params
- [ ] Empty state message when no tasks match filter
- [ ] Typecheck passes
- [ ] Verify in browser using dev-browser skill

**Validation Test:**

- **Setup:** Tasks exist at all three priority levels
- **Steps:**
  1. Open the task list (default filter: All)
  2. Select 'High' from the filter dropdown
  3. Copy the current URL and open it in a new tab
  4. Change filter to a priority with no matching tasks
- **Expected Result:** Step 2 shows only high-priority tasks. Step 3 loads with the High filter already applied. Step 4 shows an empty state message (not a blank page).
- **Failure Indicator:** Filter doesn't hide tasks, URL doesn't preserve filter, or empty state is missing

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: Add `priority` field to tasks table ('high' | 'medium' | 'low', default 'medium')
- FR-2: Display colored priority badge on each task card
- FR-3: Include priority selector in task edit modal
- FR-4: Add priority filter dropdown to task list header
- FR-5: Sort by priority within each status column (high to medium to low)

## Non-Goals

- No priority-based notifications or reminders
- No automatic priority assignment based on due date
- No priority inheritance for subtasks

## Technical Considerations

- Reuse existing badge component with color variants
- Filter state managed via URL search params
- Priority stored in database, not computed

## Success Metrics

- Users can change priority in under 2 clicks
- High-priority tasks immediately visible at top of lists
- No regression in task list performance

## Open Questions

- Should priority affect task ordering within a column?
- Should we add keyboard shortcuts for priority changes?
```
